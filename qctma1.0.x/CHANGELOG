[1.0.4]
- Added a __version__ variable in qctma.py and rw_cdb.py file
- Added a CHANGLEOG file.

[1.0.5]
- Corrected figures in report file

[1.0.6]
- Corrected writing of CDB file (missing "MPTEMP,R5.0, 1, 1,  0.00000000    ," line between each material data).

[1.0.7]
- Support processing with no use of multiprocessing (default)
- If no save_file_path given, write the created cdb with the same name as the source cdb, with "_QCTMA" added at the end.

[1.0.8]
- Added functions in rw_cdb to extract Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density from cdb file.

[1.0.9]
- Changed fixed degree of gaussian quadrature to "get_good_scheme" function from quadpy.
- Corrected "reduce_material" function to avoid inappropriate low density/E values (e.g. negative values).

[1.0.10]
- Removed pyansys package which caused installation issues.

[1.0.11]
- Removed unnecessary packages from setuptool and requirements.

[1.0.12]
- Lowered versions of necessary packages for compatibility issues.

[1.0.13]
- Changed printing of occuring process.
- Changed inv_num function to simplify it. Must be changed again in future for better generalization.

[1.0.14]
- Added a gaussian filter option.

[1.0.15]
- Modified gaussian filter to be applied on the density matrix, with a window size of 3 pixels.

[1.0.16]
- Added a window/kernel option for the Gaussian filter.

[1.0.17]
- Added option to exclude elements from material assignment and create an "empty" material for them.

[1.0.18]
- Added nifti reading.

[1.0.19]
- Changed import of pyquad from header to the function that used it.

[1.0.20]
- Added the possibility to use a function to define a plastic (bilinear) material law.

[1.0.21]
- Corrected the eventuality of having a negative density even though graylevel2density function is supposed to avoid it.

[1.0.22]
- Corrected initialization of plastic_pool when saving mesh.

[1.0.23]
- Corrected the eventuality of having a wrong ordering of the dicom slices (force ordering by slice position).

[1.0.24]
- Removed dependency requiring a licence.

[1.0.25]
- Corrected the eventuality of having a wrong ordering of the dicom slices (force ordering by slice position).

[1.0.26]
- Added an exception to support the case where Ansys does not input 0 for the z coordinate when it's the case.

[1.0.27]
- Added nibabel as a dependency.
